# Unhandled JSON Decoding and Missing Key Errors in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving unhandled exceptions during JSON decoding and accessing missing keys from a JSON response. The example shows how to improve error handling for better app stability.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the error, and `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
